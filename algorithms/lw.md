Use the following method to calculate the grade level of a text using the Linsear Write formula:

1) Find a 100-word sample from your writing.

2) Calculate the easy words (defined as two syllables or less) and place a number "1" over each word, even including a, an, the, and other simple words.

3) Calculate the hard words (defined as three syllables or more) and place a number "3" over each word as pronounced by the dictionary.

4A) Multiply the number of easy words times "1."
4B) Multiply the number of hard words times "3."

5) Add the two previous numbers together.

6) Divide that total by the number of sentences.

7A) If your answer is >20, divide by "2," and that is your answer.

7B) If your answer is <20 or equal to 20, subtract "2," and then divide by "2." That is your answer.

Because sentence length and 3+ syllable words influence the results of the Linsear Write formula, you can use shorter sentences and less complex words (1 or 2 syllable words) to lower the score (grade level).
